# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub

**Flutter & iOS Lead Developer**  
**AI-Augmented Engineering | LLM Workflows | Mobile Architecture**  
**Founder @ [smolikja.team](https://smolikja.team)**

I build mobile applications (Flutter & native iOS) with a strong focus on clean architecture, long-term maintainability and AI-augmented workflows. Over the past years I’ve worked on B2B and B2G applications used by thousands of users — including sport event apps, healthcare products and public sector applications.

Beyond my work at CGI, I run **smolikja.team**, a small mobile development unit where we build and maintain real-world mobile products and infrastructure.
